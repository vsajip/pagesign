What is it?
===========

`age <https://age-encryption.org/>`_ and `minisign
<https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/>`_ are modern command-line programs which
respectively provide support for encryption/decryption and signing/verification of
data. It is possible to provide programmatic access to their functionality by spawning
separate processes to run them and then communicating with those processes from your
program.

This project, ``pagesign``, implements a Python library which takes care
of the internal details and allows its users to generate and manage keys,
encrypt and decrypt data, and sign and verify messages using `age` and `minisign`.

This library does not install `age` or `minisign` for you: you will need to install
them yourself. It expects functionality found in age v1.0.0 or later, and minisign
v0.8 or later. Three programs are expected to be found on the PATH: `age-keygen`,
`age` and `minisign`. If any of them aren't found, this library won't work as expected.
